                    <p>Late 2021 i decided too change career.
                        I enrolled in codeinstitutes Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (E-Commerce ) <br><br>
                        where i did a total of 5 projects varying from static htlm site to a E-commerce
                        platform.<br><br>

                        I am an enthusiastic, adaptable, focused, and motivated Junior Fullstack Developer with a
                        passion for the Front end who is seeking an opportunity to keep learning and to contribute my
                        knowledge to real projects.<br><br>

                        During my one year at codeinstitute, there were many practical tasks with building web
                        applications and solving complex problems of web development using different development tools.
                        I have a great desire to develop myself in this field, learn from the best teams and work hard
                        to bring value to the company and build solutions together.
                        <br><br>

                        I have a flexible mindset and good communicational skills, I am a great team member.
                        Motivated to learn future trends, and new technologies as fast as I can.
